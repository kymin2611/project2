  English is the third most-spoken native language in the world,
  after Standard Chinese and Spanish.[10] It is the most widely learned second
  language and is either the official language or one of the official languages
  in almost 60 sovereign states. There are more people who have learned it
  as a second language than there are native speakers. English is the most
  commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada,
  Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, and it is widely spoken in some areas
   of the Caribbean, Africa and South Asia.[11] It is a co-official language
   of the United Nations, the European Union and many other world and regional
   international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language,
    accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch.
    English has a vast vocabulary, though counting how many words any language
    has is impossible.[12][13] English speakers are called "Anglophones".</p>
