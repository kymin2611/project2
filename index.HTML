<br> <h2> English </h2>
<p> English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval
  England and <STRONG>eventually became <U>a global lingua</U> franca</STRONG>.[4][5]
  Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area
  of Britain that would later take their name, England, both names ultimately
  deriving from the Anglia peninsula in the Baltic Sea.
  It is closely related to the Frisian languages,
  but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages,
   particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and French.[6]
</p>
<p style = "margin-top:45px;"> English has developed over the course of
  more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English,
  a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain
  by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are called Old English.
  Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of
  England and was a period in which the language was influenced by French.[7]
  Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of
  the printing press to London, the printing of the King James Bible
  and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.[8]</p>
